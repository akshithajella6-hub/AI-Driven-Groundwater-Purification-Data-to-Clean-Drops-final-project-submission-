This project predicts the purity level of groundwater (Safe / Unsafe) using a machine-learning model built in Python.The backend is a Flask API that receives water-quality measurements 
in JSON format and returns the predicted water status.
Features:
- Pre-trained machine-learning model (Random Forest & Logistic Regression).
- REST API endpoint predict that accepts water-quality parameters and
  responds with `Safe` or `Unsafe`.
- Built entirely with Python 3.12.
